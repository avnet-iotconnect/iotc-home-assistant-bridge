# Example configuration.yaml snippet (OPTIONAL) - mqtt_statestream
#
# mqtt_statestream is useful for "everything has a topic", but it publishes lots
# of metadata (friendly_name, last_changed, timestamps) that may not map cleanly
# to typed IoTConnect telemetry. For analytics, prefer Option A automations.
